1. Nodejs and NPM should be installed in the system
2. RUN -> npm install
3. RUN -> node app.js
4. OR just RUN -> npm start (it will internally install all node modules and run the server)

Finally your server is running at 7527 :)

If you already put the frontend build code in www folder then just run http://localhost:7527 in your browser
